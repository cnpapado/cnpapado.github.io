I am a first year PhD student at Northwestern University advised by [Prof. Jakub Szefer](https://caslab.io/jakub/). I am broadly interested in quantum computing architectures and quantum computing security.

Before joining Northwestern, I obtained my (integrated MSc+BSc) diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, and spend a year working as research assistant at <a href="http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/">NTUA CSLab</a> under Prof. <a href="http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~pnevmati/">Dionisios Pnevmatikatos</a>. During my senior year at NTUA, I was also a visitor at <a href="https://www.space.dtu.dk/english/">DTU Space</a> investigating hardware-assisted fault tolerance techniques for spaceborne processors. In my younger academic years I also worked briefly with Prof. <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/~stavros/">Stavros Tripakis</a> on neural network robustness formal verification.

Outside academia, I enjoy playing music, amateur astronomy and racing in offshore sailing.
